# Learn Effect TS

## Description

I've been using functional programming for quite a while with FP-TS and wanted to switch over to Effect-TS to see what I like better. I'll add a few examples every night until i've mastered the library.

## Why Effect TS (really why functional programming)
- Composability - Meaning it's easy to maintain, read and breakdown into it's smallest parts
- Type Saftey - Using typescripts strict type system you can ensure programs do exactly what you think they will do
- Async code - Async and sync code are written the same

## What is Effect ?
Immutable representation of a program, value or workflow in other words a box for your logic you want to implement
